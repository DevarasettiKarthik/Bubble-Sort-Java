# Bubble Sort in Java

## Description
This program demonstrates the implementation of **Bubble Sort** in Java.
Bubble sort sorts the array by repeatedly comparing **adjacent elements** and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.

## How It Works
- Reads the size of the array
- Stores elements in an array
- Compares adjacent elements
- Swaps them if the left element is greater than the right element
- Repeats the process until the array is sorted

## Input Format
<array_size>
<array_elements>

## Sample Input
5
5 1 4 2 8

## Output
1 2 4 5 8

## Time Complexity
- Best Case: O(n)
- Average Case: O(n²)
- Worst Case: O(n²)

## Space Complexity
O(1)

## Characteristics
- In-place sorting
- Stable
- Adaptive (optimized version)

## File Name
Bsort.java
